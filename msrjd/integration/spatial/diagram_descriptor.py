msrjd.integration.spatial.diagram_descriptor
=============================================
Backend C — **Phase 1 of the generic spatial loop pipeline**
(``docs/spatial_generic_pipeline_plan.md``): map an enumerated typed diagram onto
the C-stack's representation — internal interaction vertices (integrated times),
external legs (fixed times), and a flat edge list ``[(a, b, kind, (u, v))]`` ready
for the Symanzik momentum reduction (C0/C1) + causal-chamber time integral (C2).

This is the **one** mapping every diagram goes through — tree, bubble, tadpole,
sunset alike.  There is no bubble/tadpole branch: the distinction is whether the
edge momenta couple the loop ``ℓ`` to the external ``q`` (a property of the
Symanzik ``F``, downstream), not a property of this descriptor.

The representation (see ``docs/spatial_loop_diagram_inventory.md``): the shared
enumerator uses **all-``G_R`` propagators + explicit noise sources**.  A
correlation line ``C`` is two ``G_R`` edges meeting at a 2-point noise source
(``SourceType`` with two response legs, the ``⟨φ̃φ̃⟩`` insertion).  So the mapping:

  * **contract** each 2-point noise source: its two incident ``G_R`` edges →
    ONE ``C`` edge between the two *other* endpoints (integrating out the source
    time analytically gives ``C(Δt)=(T/m)e^{−m|Δt|}``).  A source whose two edges
    land on the *same* vertex → a ``C`` **self-loop** (``u == v``) — the tadpole;
  * every remaining ``G_R`` edge stays an ``R`` edge.  **External legs** (an edge
    touching a leaf) are ``R`` (or ``C``) edges with loop-coefficient ``a = 0``:
    they carry only ``±q`` so they drop out of the loop ``∫dᵈℓ`` and contribute a
    plain time factor — uniform with every other edge.

Edge sign convention is irrelevant to the Symanzik forms: flipping one edge's
``(a, b) → (−a, −b)`` leaves every ``Σ_e w_e a a``, ``Σ_e w_e a b``,
``Σ_e w_e b b`` invariant, so the ``C``-edge contraction may take either half's
coefficients.

Normalization: this descriptor is **kinematic only** — couplings, noise
amplitudes, and the combinatorial ``𝒮(Γ)`` all live in the enumeration's
``scalar_prefactor`` and are applied by the evaluator (Phase 2), NOT here.
