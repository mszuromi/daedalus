pipeline.spatial_operator_ir
============================
A small **operator intermediate representation** (IR) for the spatial
differential operators that appear in a field-theory action — the Laplacian
``∇²``, the time derivative ``∂_t``, and the partial spatial derivatives
``∂_{x_i}`` — together with the algebra and Fourier rules the diagrammatic
pipeline needs.

Why an IR instead of a bare ``SR.var('Laplacian')`` (the v1 approach) or Sage's
own differential objects:

* A bare *multiplicative* symbol (``D*Laplacian*phi``) loses **which field the
  derivative acts on** — ``phi*Laplacian*phi`` is ambiguous — and carries no
  operator algebra, so linearity and the homogeneous-saddle annihilation have to
  be hand-patched downstream.
* Sage's ``laplacian()`` (SageManifolds, Laplace–Beltrami) wants a manifold +
  metric + ``DiffScalarField`` objects and does **not** compose with the MSR
  field-doubling / multivariate-Taylor machinery, which works on commutative
  polynomial-ring generators.

So we host the operators as **inert Sage function applications** —
``Lap(phi)``, ``Dt(phi)``, ``Dx(phi, i)`` — which bind unambiguously to their
argument and give us free tree-walking / substitution / printing, while ALL
semantics live in explicit passes here:

* :func:`apply_linearity` — the operators are linear: they distribute over sums
  and pull out factors that are independent of the fields AND the spatial
  coordinates (constant coefficients).  ``∂(c·f) = c·∂f`` only when ``c`` is a
  genuine constant; a *position-dependent* coefficient ``f(x)·∇²φ`` is left
  ATOMIC (its product/Leibniz rule and the resulting ``f̂(p)`` momentum
  injection are a deliberately separate, later layer).
* :func:`expand_about_saddle` — substitute ``φ → φ̄ + δφ`` and re-linearize, so
  ``Lap(φ̄ + δφ) → Lap(φ̄) + Lap(δφ)``.  Linearity is applied; the mean term is
  KEPT.
* :func:`kill_means` — a SEPARATE, contingent pass: annihilate ``Lap(φ̄)`` (and
  ``Dx(φ̄,i)``, ``Dt(φ̄)``) ONLY when the saddle is homogeneous / stationary.
  An inhomogeneous mean-field solution (a front, a pattern) that solves the MF
  PDE keeps its ``Lap(φ̄)`` — it cancels the rest of the stationarity condition,
  it is not silently dropped.  This is why linearity and annihilation are two
  passes, not one.
* :func:`to_derived_generators` — replace each atomic operator-on-fluctuation
  ``Lap(δφ)``, ``Lap(Lap(δφ))``, ``Dx(δφ,i)`` with a fresh **ring generator**
  ``v``, so the existing ``FieldTheory.expand`` multivariate Taylor treats it
  like any other field (the ``u=δφ, v=∇²δφ`` trick).  Returns the rewritten
  expression plus a map ``generator → (base, operator-chain)``.
* :func:`form_factor` — the Fourier image of an operator chain on a leg of
  momentum ``k`` / frequency ``ω``:  ``Lap → −k²``, ``Dt → −iω``,
  ``Dx_i → i k_i``, composed multiplicatively (``Lap∘Lap → k⁴``).

Deferred (documented, not yet implemented): the Leibniz/product rule for
position-dependent coefficients and the corresponding ``f̂(p)`` injection;
operators nested *inside products* (``Lap(Lap(δφ)·ψ)``) beyond a single base.
