# The generic spatial loop pipeline (the plan)

*Branch `spatial-extension`, May 2026.  This is the authoritative plan for the
spatial loop calculation.  It replaces the **bespoke** bubble/tadpole paths with
a single generic per-diagram evaluator.  Companion: `spatial_loop_diagram_inventory.md`
(how the enumerator represents a spatial diagram) and `backend_C_math.md` /
`backend_C_design.md` (the Schwinger/Symanzik math).*

## The principle

**One path.  Evaluate every enumerated diagram the same way and sum them.**
Tree, bubble, tadpole, sunset — all just diagrams.  The bubble-vs-tadpole
distinction is *never a branch in the code*; it is purely a property of the
Symanzik output (does the loop momentum couple to the external `q`?), computed
automatically.

We follow **strict fixed order** (sum diagrams; no Dyson resummation) — the same
convention the validated time-only `compute_correction_td` uses.  In fact:

> **This is the momentum-first replacement for `compute_correction_td`** —
> identical job (evaluate a full correlator diagram's contribution to the
> cumulant), but the loop momentum is done by Schwinger/Symanzik instead of the
> broken uniform `Laplacian = −q²` substitution, and the time integral by causal
> chambers + smooth quadrature instead of the close-pair-prone exp-product
> time-polytope.

### Why "full diagram", not "self-energy + Dyson"

The enumerator emits **full** correlator diagrams (external legs + noise sources
included), not amputated self-energies.  Evaluating the full diagram → `δC`
directly means:
* no Dyson assembly, no `Σ_R`/`Σ_K` split, no 1PI-vs-1PR taxonomy;
* external legs are just **R edges with loop-coefficient `a = 0`** (they carry
  only `±q`, so they drop out of the loop `∫dᵈℓ` and contribute a plain
  `e^{−m_q·Δt}` time factor) — uniform with every other edge;
* the dropped-tadpole problem **evaporates**: there is no place left to drop a
  diagram — you sum all of them.

```

Everything labeled EXISTING is built and validated in isolation
(`momentum_routing`, `spatial_reduce` C0/C1, `temporal_integrate` + the new
`causal_chambers` C2, and the `q→x` transforms).  The work is the NEW glue +
wiring + deletion.

### Normalization (the one subtlety to pin in Phase 2)

The enumeration prefactor (e.g. `8·T²·g²`) already carries the couplings, noise
amplitudes, AND the combinatorial `M(Γ)`.  So the C-stack must supply only the
**kinematic** part — run it with noise/coupling set to 1 (a bare C edge
contributes its Schwinger `e^{−m|Δt|}/m`, no extra `T`) and multiply by the
enumeration `M(Γ)·prefactor`.  Mixing both would double-count `T`.  This is
exactly the normalization that validation against `loop_dyson` will pin.

## Phases (each gated by a validation)

| Phase | Deliverable | Validation gate |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1** | `diagram_to_cstack(td)` — pure descriptor mapping | reproduces `bubble_edges('R')` from diagram 0, `bubble_edges('C')` from diagram 1; flags diagram 2 as a tadpole self-loop |
| **2** | generic per-diagram evaluator; full bubble at fixed `(q,τ)` (Symanzik + chamber/Schwinger + external-leg poset threading) | `Σ` over bubble diagrams reproduces `loop_dyson`'s `δC(q,τ)` (B≈0.99-vs-sim, machine-precision-vs-∫dℓ) **with NO pinned `24/C_R/C_K`** |
| **3** | tadpole through the *same* evaluator (no new code) | matches analytic `⟨φ²⟩₀·∂C₀/∂A`; q-independence falls out of Symanzik `F` automatically |
| **4** | sum all diagrams + wire into `compute.py` (replace bespoke dispatch) | end-to-end reaction-diffusion `C(x,τ)` at 1-loop = Phase-2 bubble + Phase-3 tadpole; **decisive test vs simulation** (complete 1-loop vs bubble-alone) |
| **5** | multi-vertex / ≥3 chambers | 2-loop sunset via the generic path vs the brute-force `∫dℓ₁dℓ₂` oracle (W11) |
| **6** | delete the bespoke code | `compute_spatial_correlator_bubble`/`_one_loop`, `_BUBBLE_MGAMMA=24`, `loop_dyson`'s `C_R/C_K`, `_diagram_is_bubble` dispatch — all gone; `loop_dyson` demoted to a test oracle then removed; docs + full regression |

## The honest hard parts (where the risk is)

1. **External-leg → poset threading** (Phase 2): map the two external times
   `{0, τ}` onto the causal poset's fixed bounds (`_CausalPoset.scalar_lowers /
   scalar_uppers`).  The temporal `_extract_causal_poset` already does the
   analogous thing — adapt, don't reinvent.
2. **Correlation-Schwinger × chamber composition** (Phase 2/5): each C edge adds
   an `s_e ∈ [|Δt|,∞)` integral nested inside the chamber quadrature.
   `sigma_parametric` does this for 2-vertex; generalizing to the chamber core is
   the new bit — validated against the sunset oracle.
3. **d≥2 UV cutoff consistency** (Phase 3/4): the tadpole `∫dᵈℓ` is UV-sensitive;
   the Symanzik small-`w` corner is the cutoff (Regime 1).  Thread the cutoff
   consistently.

## What dies (Phase 6)

`compute_spatial_correlator_bubble`, `compute_spatial_correlator_one_loop`, the
pinned `_BUBBLE_MGAMMA = 24`, `loop_dyson`'s `C_R=4/C_K=2`, and `_diagram_is_bubble`
as a dispatch fork — **all replaced** by one evaluator where the distinctions are
automatic.  `loop_dyson` survives only as an independent test oracle until the
generic path is fully validated, then is removed.

## Status

- [x] C2-full chamber core (`causal_chambers.py`) — the multi-vertex time
      integral primitive (tests green).
- [x] Reconnaissance: the enumerator's diagram representation + the
      enumerated-diagram → C-stack mapping rule (`spatial_loop_diagram_inventory.md`).
- [ ] Phase 1 … Phase 6 (this plan).
